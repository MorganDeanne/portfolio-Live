            <h2>VGS Banner/Logo Redesign</h2>
            <p id="subtext">A redesign of the Edge Hill Video Game Society logo for socials</p>
            <p>In 2019, I was the secratary of the Edge Hill Video Game Society. I realised that the previous logo was a bit outdated. The colours came from the previous hoodies for the society, and there wasn’t really a theme to tie everything together.</p><p><br/> So I used Canva, and designed a new banner and make some small tweaks. This project allowed me to get comfortable with Canva and was mainly just for fun!</p>

            <div class="indivWorkText" id="indivWorkText1">
                <p>I started off with this silhouette I found on google images as it holds a variety of video game characters which represents the society, lots of different people and lot's of different games happening.</p>

            <img alt="Silhouettes of video game characters in purple" id="VGSImage2" src="../images-Home/VGS-GraphicDesign-2.png"/>
            <div class="indivWorkText" id="indivWorkText2">
                <p>I took this image, and made it so the characters itself were white and the made them slightly transparent, just so they are not bright and take away from the information we want displaying - the logo and the text.</p>

            <img alt="" id="IndivWorkSparkle1" src="../images-Home/sparkle-right.png"/>

                <img alt="" id="indivWorkArrow2" src="../images-Home/arrowDoodleRightHigh.png"/>
                <p>I added a circle which encompases the mushroom logo which we had originally and added a solid purple background to the circle as if it was transparent, it was a bit muddled. I then added the text “Edge Hill Video Game Society” so everyone knew who we were, the text also has the purple background as plain to once again help with those sections don’t look too cluttered.</p>
