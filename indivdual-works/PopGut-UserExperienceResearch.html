            <h2>PopGut - User Experience Design and Research</h2>
            <p id="subtext"> A small project to explore UX Design routes and Keyword Research  </p>
            <p>I felt like i needed a small project to solidify my knowledge with user cases and user experience research and design. So I used <a href="https://goodbrief.io/">goodbrief.io</a> to create a random project for me to work on. </p> <p> I focused on keyword research, user journeys and creating user personas to guide the design process. If you want to see a more indepth view of how I went about this project, take a look below.</p>
            
        </div>

    <section id="indivWorkBotRed" class="indivWorkBot">
        <h2>The Process</h2>
        <p>For this project I used Miro note for the user and keywords (<a href="https://miro.com/welcomeonboard/MUlJbnRMZDlOZ01VcDdGTUZxODduVlJacUE0WGJpSmdqcGlUYmY0V01pVGNnQlBmTVRQeWU5bXM3VVBFMnFjeHwzMDc0NDU3MzYwOTYzMDMwNzYw?invite_link_id=957162798905">link to miro project</a>) and Figma for the prototype and display of research (<a href="https://www.figma.com/file/zkVP7aThdfOxjGobuEGYrC/Popgut?node-id=0%3A1">link to Figma project</a>).</p>
        <div class="indivWorkSection">
            <div class="indivWorkText" id="indivWorkText1">
                <p>As previously stated, i used <a href="https://goodbrief.io/">goodbrief.io</a> to create a random design breif for this project</p>
                <img alt="" id="IndivWorkArrow1" src="../images-Home/arrowDoodleRightLow.png"/>
                <p>The breif given was for PopGut, a recipe websitethat uses a call to action on the main page for free samples to it's produce. I interpreted this design as a recipe box company, much like Hello Fresh or Guasto. The target audience was couples and people who are on the go. </p>
            </div>
            <img alt="An image of the explained brief, with the company name, description and what the job wants from the project." id="PortfolioImage1" src="../images-Home/PopGut-UserExperienceDesign-image1.png"/>
        </div>
        <div id="section2" class="indivWorkSection">
            <img alt="" id="PortfolioImage2" src="../images-Home/PopGut-UserExperienceDesign-image2.png"/>
            <div class="indivWorkText" id="indivWorkText2">
                <p>With the brief in mind, I got to work on figuring out who exactly the user is for this project. I created some simple user goals and challenges and just tried to think of all the ideas I had surrounding couples, on the go and nostalgia. This made me think of potentially parents who are looking to do a date night or a couple who are rekindling the feeling of a first date. </p>
            </div>
            <img alt="" id="IndivWorkSparkle1" src="../images-Home/sparkle-right.png"/>
            
        </div>
        <div id="section3" class="indivWorkSection">
            <div class="indivWorkText" id="indivWorkText2">
                <img id="indivWorkArrow2" src="../images-Home/arrowDoodleRightHigh.png"/>
                <p>I then started to think about the brand and what they would want to have in terms of SEO usage and keywords. I wrote a list of 6 keywords I thought would fit the brand, then used Google Trends to find related keywords to improve the SEO and make sure the website hit as many key points as possible.</p>
                <p> I then did research it potential competitive brands such as HelloFresh and Guasto and checked thier keywords trends and related words, to see if there was any potential keywords that the company PopGut could potentially capitaslise on.  </p>
            </div>
            <img id="PortfolioImage3" src="../images-Home/PopGut-UserExperienceDesign-image3.png"/>

        <div id="section4" class="indivWorkSection">
            <img id="PortfolioImage3" src="../images-Home/PopGut-UserExperienceDesign-image5.png"/>
            <div class="indivWorkText" id="indivWorkText2">
                <p>With the keywords done and the potential users being identified, it was then time to create the personas for this project. I created three (which you can check out on my Figma Project), with the three personas highlighting different needs and goals that the company wants this brand to touch on. I created these personas thier own user stories to help highlight these wants and needs aswell.</p>
            </div>
            <img alt="" id="IndivWorkSparkle1" src="../images-Home/sparkle-right.png"/>
            
        </div>
        
        <div id="section5" class="indivWorkSection">
            <div class="indivWorkText" id="indivWorkText1">
                <p>I then created a User Experience map with the potential pain points of using the website and motivations behind using this website. Using these challeneges enabled me to create potential interview questions for users if this was a pre-existing website, and then the potential outcomes that came from this user map. </p>
                <img alt="" id="IndivWorkArrow1" src="../images-Home/arrowDoodleRightLow.png"/>
            </div>
            <img alt="" id="PortfolioImage2" src="../images-Home/PopGut-UserExperienceDesign-image6.png"/>
        </div>
        
        <div id="section6" class="indivWorkSection">
            <img id="PortfolioImage2" src="../images-Home/PopGut-UserExperienceDesign-image7.png"/>
            <div class="indivWorkText" id="indivWorkText2">
                <p>To finish off my user research, I created a site map to show the necessary pages for the website. I also created a website flow map to display how the site would connect with eachother in the final product.</p>
            </div>
            <img alt="" id="IndivWorkSparkle1" src="../images-Home/sparkle-right.png"/>
            
        </div>
        
        <div id="section7" class="indivWorkSection">
            <div class="indivWorkText" id="indivWorkText2">
                <img id="indivWorkArrow2" src="../images-Home/arrowDoodleRightHigh.png"/>
                <p>Finally, I created a basic prototype to show the proof of conecpt for the project. In the future I may continue this project, however for now this project was iun a good place to be put on hold. It helped me understand user experience a bit more and solidify my knowledge within the subject, and allowed me to learn a bit more about SEO research and using tools like User Experience maps.</p>
