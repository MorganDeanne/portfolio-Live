            <h2>The Little Black Pen</h2>
            <p id="subtext">A project for looking into the trend of motion design for product selling</p>
            <p>In 2021, I had a module for University called “Portfolio Project”, where our tutor took a module to fill in any knowledge gaps. I chose to do a “Still life animated website” to sell any product in your own house. The only criteria was creating your own content - both text and images - and using motion design was encouraged. <br/> This seemed a little more creative than previous works, so I decided to give this a go.</p>

            <div class="indivWorkText" id="indivWorkText1">
                <p>To start off, I researched a bit about motion design in general. I looked at some sites and one of wich I fell in love with design. If you visit <a href="https://sakarisake.com/">sakarisake.com</a>, then you are greated with a beautiful website, full of rich history and glorious designs, As you scroll, more informaiton is given and is displayed in a satifying but not to jarring way.</p>

                <p>Seeing the expectation, It was quite daunting, however I was eager to get started</p>

            <div class="indivWorkText" id="indivWorkText2">
                <p>So I started to think, what is something everyone has in thier home? A pen. Everyone has that one pen that’s always knocking about. So picked up my own black pen and took various photos of it (here are some of the photos I took). I also went into GIMP 2.0 and edited the pen to be two seperate parts, the barrel and the lid. </p>
            </div>
            <img alt="" id="IndivWorkSparkle1" src="../images-Home/sparkle-right.png"/>

        <div id="section2" class="indivWorkSection">
            <div class="indivWorkText" id="indivWorkText2">
                <img alt="" id="indivWorkArrow2" src="../images-Home/arrowDoodleRightHigh.png"/>
                <p>With these images, I got thinking into the necessary content for the pen. I needed a title which I ended up on “Little Black Pen” as it is an essenctial item in every home that small but mighty!</p> 
                <p> With the title, I chose a font that looked like it was wrote with the exact pan. I created some information on the pen, like the barrel size and the colour. The next section is were I was inspired by the sakari website. I wanted the pen to be floating and I loved the texture of the napkin behind the bottle of sake. So with this in mind, my design featured a the pen, which upon scrolling, the lid would collapse onto the pen, and the paper texture in the background would slide behind the pen. </p> 
                <p> The photos would slide in from the sides adjacent to eachother. I then added some small little reviews of the pen, which used the same font as the title to tie it all in. </p>
